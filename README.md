Project Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is focused on developing a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions. In todayâ€™s digital economy, real-time fraud detection is essential for protecting both financial institutions and their customers from significant losses.

Objectives
Data Preprocessing: Addressing missing values, scaling features, and resolving class imbalance through techniques such as undersampling, oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

Model Selection: Evaluating different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier, to determine the most effective approach for fraud detection.

Evaluation Metrics: Using precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy to measure model performance in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Key Activities
Data Exploration: Initial analysis to understand the distribution of data and feature correlations.

Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features to enhance model performance.

Model Training and Evaluation: Training and testing models on various datasets (original, scaled, undersampled, oversampled, SMOTE) and evaluating performance using confusion matrices and classification reports.

Model Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and improve fraud detection rates.

Results
Model Performance: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier models were compared based on precision, recall, and f1-score. The Decision Tree Classifier showed superior performance in recall, crucial for identifying fraudulent transactions.

Best Model: The XGBoost model applied to the oversampled dataset achieved the highest accuracy and macro-average f1-score, proving its effectiveness in detecting fraud.

Conclusion
The project successfully developed a robust fraud detection system capable of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms and various sampling techniques, the model achieved high detection accuracy, making it a valuable tool for financial institutions to combat credit card fraud.
